## Joining, and Aggregations
-Joining and aggregation: Learn how to combine and summarize datasets, while being mindful of potential pitfalls such as duplicates, incorrect join conditions, and the computational expense of joins.
-Materializing outputs: Understand the significance of outputs and why they matter.
-Validating the output of the join: Learn the importance of validating your joined dataset, as joins can sometimes introduce duplicates or errors if not executed correctly.

It is a recommended practice to analyze the outputs of your joins and the techniques introduced in the sections before, such as the Preview functionality, are a great starting point for small datasets. In this section, however, you will leverage a different Foundry tool, Contour, to help analyze the joins that you created in the previous steps. In most cases, youâ€™d be able to do your basic analyses in Preview, however Contour allows you to look through the entire data and discover bugs that would otherwise be impossible to find in Preview.
